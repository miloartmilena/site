I can't say for sure if this is my first time here. Sometimes everything seems very familiar to me and sometimes very strange.</p> <p>I was born an ugly duckling on an “Animal Farm” that has since been violently broken up. As soon as I got to know all the letters, I read everything I could get my hands on and, above all, I devoured the fairy tales.</p> <p>The tale of the ugly duckling was my favorite fairy tale, and I cried every time I read it. I still love fairy tales. I don't have to cry anymore, but I know why I cried so much back then. <br> <br> <a href="mailto:milenakostamilo@gmail.com">Send Email</a> <br> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/miloart11/">Instagram</a></p> </div> </div> <div class="image blank index1" style="color: #ffffff; background-color: #4D4D4D; width: %" data-type="image" data-maxwidth="3840" data-maxheight="2560" data-textcolor="#ffffff" data-color1="#222222" data-color2="#4D4D4D" data-color3="#6C6B6C" data-color4="#847A81" data-color5="#A0A0A0" data-color6="#D3D3D3" data-color7="" data-videoformats="h264 vp8"> <img src="//:0" width="3840" height="2560" data-url="about-me-foto" /> </div> </div> <div class="textafter"> <div class="wrapper"> <div class="post index2"> <h2>LADA</h2> <h3>The ancient Slavic goddess of spring and love.</h3> <p><br> In 2017 I moved my studio from Switzerland to Serbia and became a freelance artist. In my host country I was confronted with a lot of litter on the streets. Everything is so clean and tidy in Switzerland. But I know that appearances are deceptive. The waste may not be dumped directly on the roadside, but as a "high standard of living society" we are incredible consumers and polluters.But I didn't want to make criticism-art and decided to make art out of the plastic bottles that were lying around everywhere.</p> <p>The idea of sculpting from plastic waste was born.</p> </div> </div> <div class="image blank index2" style="color: #ffffff; background-color: #4E4432; width: %" data-type="image" data-maxwidth="3840" data-maxheight="5759" data-textcolor="#ffffff" data-color1="#342C22" data-color2="#4E4432" data-color3="#665033" data-color4="#63594E" data-color5="#7D7D7E" data-color6="#A2A0A0" data-color7="#CBC9CC" data-videoformats="h264 vp8"> <img src="//:0" width="3840" height="5759" data-url="lada" /> </div> </div> <div class="textafter"> <div class="wrapper"> <div class="post index3"> <h2>am I good?</h2> <p><br> Progress cannot be stopped, and people do not like to forgo. Maybe forgo isn't the answer either. So far, we have copied so much from nature in technology. And the most ingenious invention of nature is the cycle. Everything goes back into the cycle. Here, too, we should copy nature and create our own cycle for our overproduction of all kinds of things. So I try to make my contribution to this cycle artistically. I give a discarded plastic bottle a new spiritual and material value and thus a worthy place in this world again.</p> </div> </div> <div class="image blank index3" style="color: #ffffff; background-color: #39553F; width: %" data-type="image" data-maxwidth="2560" data-maxheight="2560" data-textcolor="#ffffff" data-color1="#0E1C11" data-color2="#39553F" data-color3="#67847C" data-color4="#908C75" data-color5="#A7A395" data-color6="#D2CCB1" data-color7="#D1C6C8" data-videoformats="h264 vp8"> <img src="//:0" width="2560" height="2560" data-url="amigoodplastic" /> </div> </div> <div class="textafter"> <div class="wrapper"> <div class="post index4"> <h2>Hermit, Lada and Harlequin</h2> <p><br> In May 2022 we exhibited with the artist group "inside-outside" in Winterthur in Hall 710. Our theme was “caminos”, the paths. For this title I decided to examine the "inner ways of a person" and exhibited the three sculptures. Hermit for transience, Harlequin for liberation and Lada for the transformation that follows. When the human seriously seeks, he encounters the impermanence of everything. This moment makes us realize that there is a big difference between knowing and experiencing impermanence. When we have grown to this realization, our liberation begins. The harlequin takes it with humor, does a headstand and empties his pockets. In this way he symbolically frees himself from heavy thoughts and any ballast.</p> </div> </div> <div class="image blank index4" style="color: #ffffff; background-color: #44332B; width: %" data-type="image" data-maxwidth="3840" data-maxheight="2560" data-textcolor="#ffffff" data-color1="#27231C" data-color2="#44332B" data-color3="#4B4433" data-color4="#2F4547" data-color5="#605A56" data-color6="#7E7B7D" data-color7="#A2A0A2" data-videoformats="h264 vp8"> <img src="//:0" width="3840" height="2560" data-url="drei-skulpturen" /> </div> </div> <div class="textafter"> <div class="wrapper"> <div class="post index5"> <h2>“dance with me”</h2> <p><br> In 2021 I applied for an exhibition in the USA. The exhibition was organized by a non-profit organization called ” Embracing Our Differences”, based in Sarasota, Florida, which uses the power of arts and education to expand consciousness and open the heart to celebrate the diversity of the human family.” Quote from their website. The topic was also “embracing our differences”. I was not accepted, but one of my favorite sculptures "dance with me" was created. I was inspired by folk dances where everyone dances together in a circle. I imagine our ancient ancestors dancing like this to charge themselves with courage and energy. So, my little sculpture represents such a dance. Each dancer has its advantages and disadvantages. Like the angel in the middle. He's missing a leg, which is probably a major handicap for dancing. But he is supported by the others. But he has wings, and his fellow dancers also benefit from this lightness and encouragement.</p> <p><p>We should dance together, not fight.<p></p> </div> </div> <div class="image blank index5" style="color: #ffffff; background-color: #655E5A; width: %" data-type="image" data-maxwidth="3840" data-maxheight="2880" data-textcolor="#ffffff" data-color1="#3B3D34" data-color2="#655E5A" data-color3="#9A5037" data-color4="#9A6755" data-color5="#978A77" data-color6="#AFABA7" data-color7="#DDDAD7" data-videoformats="h264 vp8"> <img src="//:0" width="3840" height="2880" data-url="dance-with-me" /> </div> </div> <div class="textafter"> <div class="wrapper"> <div class="post index6"> <h2>Excerpt from Genesis 3</h2> <p><br> Gen 3,1, Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the LORD God had made. He said to the woman, "Did God really say, `You must not eat from any tree in the garden'?"</p> <p>Gen 3,2, The woman said to the serpent, "We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden,</p> <p>Gen 3,3, but God did say, `You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will die.'"</p> <p>Gen 3,4, "You will not surely die," the serpent said to the woman.</p> <p>Gen 3,5, "For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil."</p> <p>Gen 3,6, When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it.</p> <p>Gen 3,7, Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves.</p> <p>So, we know the massive scenario that followed that first drama. I wonder how the story would have continued if Adam had tasted the forbidden fruit first and then given it to his wife? Or even if they both hadn't listened to the snake. Would we spend the whole day lounging in the shade of the forbidden tree, making love and eating the fruits of paradise?

Tereza had read a good deal more than they, and learned a good deal more about life, but she would never realize it. The difference between the university graduate and the autodidact lies not so much in the extent of knowledge as in the extent of vitality and self-confidence. The elan with which Tereza flung herself into her new Prague existence was both frenzied and precarious. She seemed to be expecting someone to come up to her any day and say, What are you doing here? Go back where you belong! All her eagerness for life hung by a thread: Tomas's voice. For it was Tomas's voice that had once coaxed forth her timorous soul from its hiding place in her bowels.</p> </div> </div> <div class="image blank index9" style="color: #ffffff; background-color: #615956; width: %" data-type="image" data-maxwidth="2560" data-maxheight="3413" data-textcolor="#ffffff" data-color1="#563A2F" data-color2="#615956" data-color3="#8D4930" data-color4="#91695C" data-color5="#8E877B" data-color6="#AAAAA8" data-color7="#CEC9C2" data-videoformats="h264 vp8"> <img src="//:0" width="2560" height="3413" data-url="there-is-no-safety" /> </div> </div>
